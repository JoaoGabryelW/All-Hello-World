# Languages we've already added #

- [x] **HTML**
stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows users to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headers and links to web pages or applications. 

- [x] **JAVA**
is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere, meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation

- [x] **JAVASCRIPT**
often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

- [x] **PHP**
 is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.
 PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module

- [x] **PYTHON**
is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

- [x] **TYPESCRIPT**
is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript.[5] As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.
